    "# GOAL\n",
    "\n",
    "so for this first implementation of a concept head, we're just gonna attempt to extend the context length of the model by giving the GPT a kind of recurrent hidden state that basically summarizes the previous length t window that it was looking at. to make this work imma have to train on the last context length chunk of the total sequence first, and then work backwards. each time i'll be passing the concept vector that was wanted to the previous chunk, and then regression / cosine similarity training on it. if i had a dataset other than tinyshakespeare that actually had \\<endoftext> tokens then it'd be interesting to train that last context length chunk of the sequence to predict that token. Also I might need a learnable token to separate the concept from the rest of the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "a limitation of this approach is that it only works in chunks of the context length. if it works well then this is useful bc it means we could use a shorter context length which is important because attention is quadratic in its use of compute as a function of context length. however it's not clear whether the current approach will work with varying context lengths or if it'll only give us a useable context vector for the pre-determined context length t\n",
    "\n",
    "yoooo so to speed up inference what if i ran a bunch of inferences on a bunch of sequences & got all the concept vectors that came out, then trained a GPT using cosine similarity regression rather than CEL classification to predict future concept vectors. then what i'd be able to do is after the first t tokens are created this meta-model could use the concept vector that's outputted to create all the future concept vectors, then i could run the actual model in parallel for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "in a future version i would like to allow the model to carry over all previous concept vectors it has made from this sequence rather than just the most recent one\n",
    "\n",
    "at some point i'd like to solve that dynamic context length problem. one idea i've got is to use a dataset with actual documents that end in \\<endoftext> tokens. basically i'd take the total sequence length of the document and divide by k, then do my batch training on context lengths of that size. i'd have to match up documents of the same size. and i'd have to switch from learned pos embeddings to RoPE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea to potentially explore is to use the unused outputs of the regression head for something. maybe hyperparameter control or creating higher-level concept vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "after that i would like to train the model on a dataset of separate documents where each document provides its own concept vector, so this model can essentially be used to extend my obsidian graph\n",
    "\n",
    "a big assumption with this model is that the embedding space is actually capable of carrying surprisingly complicated concepts, far more than the number of tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "another half-baked idea for the generation process is to "
